This project is an IoT-based solution for monitoring environmental conditions using an ESP32 microcontroller. It collects data from multiple sensors, including a DHT21 sensor for temperature and humidity, a Pulse sensor, and an MQ135 gas sensor for CO2 levels. The data is displayed on a web interface hosted on the ESP32
